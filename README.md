My name is Ethan, and I'm a software engineer turned Solutions Architect. I hail from the DC area, but I'm currently working remote from my [self-converted camper van](http://vanlifecoder.com) touring the country hiking, biking, paddling and coding. I've primarily a Python/Flask engineer but tends to touch every layer of the tech stack. He seeks to aggressively solve the worlds' most pervasive problems with code and data.
